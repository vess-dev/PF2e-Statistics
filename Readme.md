# PF2e-Statistics
Throw 27 regressors and 7 classifiers at PF2e creature statblocks.

Just to see if there are any correlations...

A final VotingRegressor and VotingClassifier are trained with the top 3 regressors and classifiers.

This was my senior project.

Note: The test set (unseen data) was 10% of the data set. This may be adjusted in the function split_data().
